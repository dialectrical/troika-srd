# Troika System Reference Document

This is a system reference document for the [Troika](https://www.troikarpg.com/) roleplaying game which contains all of the rules text included in the officially released [SRD Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haUfSVekt2gNab3V2CrL1Pg_sZ-ZlskphwXmSnGT9aw/edit).

The SRD is currently deployed using Netlify and can be viewed [here](https://zen-wozniak-2ba1ab.netlify.app/#/). Feel free to use it for your own games of Troika!

## Contributing

### Submitting Issues

Feel free to report any bugs, request additional features, or ask for stylistic changes. When submitting an issue, please try your best to explain the current state of the SRD and explain what you would like to see changed or added. Screenshots always help, too!

Please note: this project is intended as a reformating of the Troika SRD and new rules text *will not* be added unless it is from a source licensed by Melsonian Arts Council and released under similar terms as the SRD.

### Reporting Typographical Errors

The majority of the project's text is handled with Sanity. If you spot a typographical error, submit an issue and I'll tweak the CMS accordingly.

### Submitting Pull Requests

If you want to contribute some code, feel free to submit a pull request. If you are responding to an existing issue, link your PR to the issue and give a brief overview of what your change includes and how it relates to the issue. If you are submitting a PR without a related issue, please describe the reason for your PR and what it aims to add/fix/remove/etc.
