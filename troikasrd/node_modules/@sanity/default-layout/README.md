## Sidecar

The Sidecar will be enabled in a Studio if there is an implementations of the part `part:@sanity/default-layout/sidecar`

### `part:@sanity/default-layout/sidecar`

An implementation of `part:@sanity/default-layout/sidecar` _must_ export these:

 - `SidecarToggleButton` React component. The button which will appear in the Navbar to toggle on/off the Sidecar
 - `SidecarLayout` React component. The content of the Sidecar (once it appears)
 - `isSidecarEnabled` Function. Call this to check if the Sidecar implementation is happy and good to go (typically, the sidecar impl. wants to verify if config is present)

If you need inspiration, the `@sanity/studio-hints` package is an implementation of this part.


### `part:@sanity/default-layout/sidecar-datastore`

In addition, Sidecar relies on `part:@sanity/default-layout/sidecar-datastore`. This part already exists and shouldn't be overridden unless there's a good reason. This part exports:

- `isSidecarOpenSetting` listen to this to get realtime updates on the sidecar open/close state
- `toggleSidecarOpenState` call this to flip the sidecar open/close state
