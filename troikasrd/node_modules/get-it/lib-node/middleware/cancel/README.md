The cancel token API is based on the [cancelable promises proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancelable-promises), which is currently at Stage 1.

Code shamelessly stolen/borrowed from MIT-licensed [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios). Thanks to [Nick Uraltsev](https://github.com/nickuraltsev), [Matt Zabriskie
](https://github.com/mzabriskie) and the other contributors of that project!
